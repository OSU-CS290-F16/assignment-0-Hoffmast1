 <h2>Week 0 Update 9/25/16</h2>
 <p class = "tab">I have no experience with html so week 0 was pretty intresting. Seems like html is extremely easy to learn compared to actual 
 programming languages. The tag system seems pretty easy to understand and I got most my information from the site <a href="http://www.w3schools.com"><strong>w3schools</strong></a> .
 This site contains a library of all the tags with examples of how to use them, making it very easy to build basic html sites</p>
